External data need to be downloaded to get the environmental data and be able to make predictions over the environmental space. To do so, run all scripts in the _scripts directory in numeric order from the root project directory. 

SC-GAMs generated in Valle et al. (2024) can be directly build running the script from _scripts/06_SCGAMs directory using the data uploaded to the _data directory of this repository.
