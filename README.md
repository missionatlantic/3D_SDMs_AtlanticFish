Repository for code and generated data for " Pan-Atlantic 3D distribution model incorporating water column for commercial fish " by Mireia Valle, Eduardo Ramirez-Romero, Leire Ibaibarriaga, Leire Citores, Jose A. Fernandes-Salvador, and Guillem Chust, published in Ecological Modelling journal (2024).

External data need to be downloaded to get the environmental data and be able to make predictions over the environmental space. To do so, run all scripts in the _scripts directory in numeric order from the root project directory. 

SC-GAMs generated in Valle et al. (2024) can be directly build running the script from _scripts/06_SCGAMs directory using the data uploaded to the _data directory of this repository.
